# Backend Engineering Assignment

Henry Chao - Submission

## Getting Started

The server requires the following programs:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [nodejs v10.16.0LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To get started locally, run the following commands on the project root directory:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

This will install the needed npm dependencies and start a server running locally on port `3000` by default.

## Assessment

To execute the assessment execute the `yarn asssess` command. This will trigger the `newman` run and return the assessment results (see the details of the `newman` run command within the `package.json` file).
